# Package org.jbali.json

This package contains a legacy JSON implementation copied from JSON.org,
and nothing else. New use of this code is discouraged.

Modern JSON utilities can be found in `org.jbali.json2`, and `org.jbali.kotser` when they
are related to the `kotlin-serialization` specific implementation.
